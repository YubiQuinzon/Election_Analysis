# Election Analysis

## Project Overview:
We aim to help Tom, a Colorado board of elections employee, with analyzing an election audit of the tabulated results for the U.S congressional precinct in Colorado. Our task is to report the total of number of votes casted, total number of votes casted for each candiate, the percentage of votes for each canidate, and the winner of the election. We are also tasked with indicating the county with the largest voter turnout, how many votes were casted in that county, and how much of the total percentage of votes it holds. 

## Resources
In order to complete the analysis, we looked into using these resources:
- election_results.csv
  - A csv file that contains the data we will use to help us reach our goals.
- Visual Studio Code, Python 3.7.6 64-bit (system):
  - This is the software we used the write, interpret, and run out code to help analyze our data.

## Summary
Summary of the new found results
- Total number of votes = 369,711
- The candiates, the number of votes they recieved, and the percentage of votes:
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
- The winning canidate: Diana DeGette
- The counties included, the number of votes casted within each county, and the percentage of votes:
  - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
- The county with the largest voter turnout: Denever

## Election-Audit Summary:
This script was written in a way which can be used again in many different purposes. One of the most obvious ways this script can be used is to create an analysis report for elections in other counties. The only thing you would need to pass is the correct corressponding data. One way this script can be improved on is to analyzes what was the majority vote for each county. As we can see, Denever county accounted for most of the votes. If it was shown that most of Denever county had voted for the winning canidate, maybe this can lay out future plans for upcoming canidates. They can focus more on the interest of the people of Denever county to ensure greater odds of winning the race.
